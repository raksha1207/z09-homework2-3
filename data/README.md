# Data Policy

## Course Rules
|Right| Notes|
|-----|------|
|The **right to  privacy**|No one should be able to identify individuals in your data. Don't store free text names in Github!|
| The **right to refuse**| Any member of this class, when called to an lab session, has the right to decline to participate without having to explain why (in which case, they still get their chit).|
| The **right to be forgotten**| Any one you collect data from has the right to require their data deleted from your study. So keep anonymous ids for everyone, keep a mapping table real name to anonymous (outside of Github).|

## Group 9 Implementation
- **In accordance with the above**, all data collected in this study will be tied to anonymized IDs. Real names will be kept in an offline spreadsheet, separate from this repository.
- Data to be collected includes:
  - In-session: time to first bug, time to complete each program, program run success
  - Post-session: number of bugs identified, number of bugs missed, number of bugs fixed, time spent per bugfix
  - Via survey: experience with target languages, correlation between target languages and top languages (Java, C, etc.)
