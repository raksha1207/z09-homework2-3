### Group 9 Game of Life Experiment
This experiment aims to compare the relative "efficiency" of three less popular programming languages - Ruby, Go, and Rust - based on how easy they are to debug a simple program in. Language selection was based on the [Tiobe Index](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) ranking for August 2020.
